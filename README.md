# PySpark Tutorial Repository

Welcome to the **PySpark Tutorial** repository! 🚀 This repository contains notebooks created in Databricks, covering essential PySpark concepts and practical examples for handling big data.

## 📘 **What is PySpark?**

**PySpark** is the Python API for Apache Spark, a distributed computing framework for large-scale data processing. It enables fast, parallelized computations across clusters and supports a range of features like SQL queries, machine learning, and streaming.

## 📂 **Repository Contents**

This repository includes the following notebooks:

1. **Data Reading and Transformation:** Loading datasets, applying transformations, and manipulating data frames.
2. **Data Writing:** Saving transformed data in various formats (CSV, Parquet, JSON, etc.).
3. **Joins and Window Functions:** Performing SQL-style joins and using window functions for advanced analytics.
4. **Spark SQL:** Running SQL queries on Spark DataFrames and leveraging SQL-like capabilities.

## 🛠️ **Setup Instructions**

To run these notebooks locally or in Databricks:

1. **Install PySpark (for local setup):**

```sh
pip install pyspark
```

2. **Clone the Repository:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/avishek7713/PySpark-Learning.git
cd PySpark-Learning
```

3. **Import to Databricks:**
- In Databricks, navigate to your workspace.
- Click **Import** → Upload the notebooks (.dbc or .ipynb files).

4. **Run the Notebooks:**
Open a notebook, attach it to a cluster, and run the cells to experiment with PySpark.
